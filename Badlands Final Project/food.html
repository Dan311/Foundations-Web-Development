                    <p> 
                        In the mood for some good, homegrown cooking? If so, then 
                        Bob's is your place. Mosey on in! You have the choice of 
                        bellying up to the counter or sitting in a cozy booth to 
                        admire the scenery of the Black Hills. The food is the 
                        real hit here. Try the pancake sandwich and you'll be 
                        glad you did. Other hits are the Oatmeal Bonfire (don't
                        ask) and the Belgian Waffle Surprise! Both are favorites
                        and have tourists coming back for more. Come early! Any 
                        time after 8:00 and you'll be competing with every tourist
                        in the Black Hills.
