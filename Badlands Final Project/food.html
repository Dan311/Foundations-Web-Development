                    <h2>Bob's Breakfast Diner</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h5>Diner with a good old-fashioned breakfast!</h5>
          
                    <p> 
                        In the mood for some good, homegrown cooking? If so, then 
                        Bob's is your place. Mosey on in! You have the choice of 
                        bellying up to the counter or sitting in a cozy booth to 
                        admire the scenery of the Black Hills. The food is the 
                        real hit here. Try the pancake sandwich and you'll be 
                        glad you did. Other hits are the Oatmeal Bonfire (don't
                        ask) and the Belgian Waffle Surprise! Both are favorites
                        and have tourists coming back for more. Come early! Any 
                        time after 8:00 and you'll be competing with every tourist
                        in the Black Hills.

                    <hr>
                    <h5>Good Greasy Spoon for the budget minded vacationer</h5>
          
                    <p> 
                        Bluto makes a good burger and is not afraid to admit it.
                        A no-frills style is made up for with an attention to 
                        detail. A lot of hits here but one miss is the Popeye
                        burger - who wants cold, canned spinach on a burger? Not 
                        Bluto. Shakes are out of this world. All are made with a 
                        custard-base and mixed with an unrivaled quality. The kids 
                        will love the video games in the back. Just bring enough
                        quarters to beat them in Pole Position.
